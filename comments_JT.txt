Hi David, 

thnx for this script. 

One request. For readability, could you please include the argument names of functions and try to add comments in your script. 

Thus not: 

amsterdam_uni <- opq ("Amsterdam, The Netherlands")

but

amsterdam_uni <- opq (getbb("Amsterdam, The Netherlands")) #getting the bounding box of the city of Amsterdam and make it an overpass query object 

It is also nice to include a brief description of new packages. 


Thus 

osmdata: package to retrieve open street map data. See: https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata/
